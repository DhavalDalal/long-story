# Long Story

The team uses Java and SpringBoot stack to Currently the codebase is using 
Context: Java, SpringBoot


## Problem Statement

## Stories

## How do we Collaborate?
* You may form 2-3 different ensembles, with one working on long-lived change, and the other ensembles working on faster releases of the short stories or

* You may form 3-4 pairs, with one pair working on long-lived change, and the   remaining pairs working on faster releases of the short stories.

## Constraints
### Part 1 Thou shall use a branch for the long story
Constraint: You must use an SCM branch on which this long story will be developed.  You may or may not use short-lived branches for other stories and then merge it back to main when you are done with that story.


### Part 2 Use Main Branch Only
Constraint: Use main branch only for all the stories, you are not allowed to create branch for any stories.


## Learning Retrospective
* What do you think about Long-lived branches?
* What was your experience with merges?
* What if, business changes their mind while story is progressing on long-lived branch?
